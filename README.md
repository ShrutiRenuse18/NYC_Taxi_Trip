**New York Taxi Trip Duration Prediction**

The objective of predicting taxi trip durations is to optimize transportation infrastructure and traffic management,
thereby improving the experience for both passengers and drivers in New York City.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-**
* Patterns and Temporal Insights: Analysis of trip durations revealed significant patterns across different times of day and days of the week, highlighting peak demand periods and traffic congestion.

* Geospatial and Feature Correlations: Examining the spatial distribution of trip origins and destinations, along with feature correlations (e.g., trip distance, pickup location, weather conditions), provided insights into traffic flow and factors affecting trip duration.

* Outlier and Anomaly Management: Identification and correction of outliers and anomalies ensured the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.
